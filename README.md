Hi, I'm Yejin Moon

I'm a customer-centric software engineer who believes that great products start with understanding real user needs. I enjoy building systems that are both technically robust and genuinely helpful for the people who use them.

About Me
Final Year @ Imperial College London

As a final-year MEng Computing student, I am currently exploring:

Hardware for machine learning through CUDA programming

Decentralised finance and smart contract development with Solidity

I enjoy connecting high-performance computing, distributed systems, and product thinking.

Industry Experience
Software Engineering Intern, Solidatus

At Solidatus — a B2B SaaS company that builds a data lineage platform for large enterprises — I worked as a full-stack engineer (TypeScript and C#). My work included:

Shipping a major new feature on the lineage model editor

Building an agentic AI system embedded directly into the platform

Collaborating closely with UX to improve usability for non-technical users

Gaining exposure to financial data lineage, enterprise data workflows, and cross-team engineering practices

Research & Final Year Project
Self-Contradiction Detection in Public Figures' Speech

My final year project focuses on building an NLP system that detects contradictions in public figures’ statements over time. This involves:

Natural language inference

Temporal reasoning

Analysis of real-world political and public discourse
