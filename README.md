## About Me

I am a final-year MEng Computing student at Imperial College London. My current academic interests include:

* Hardware acceleration for machine learning (CUDA Programming)
* Decentralised finance and smart contract development (Solidity)
* Computational modelling and simulation of neuronal activity 

I enjoy connecting low-level systems knowledge with high-level design and product thinking.

## Industry Experience

### Software Engineering Intern — Solidatus

Solidatus is a B2B SaaS company building a data lineage platform for global financial institutions.
During my internship, I:

* Delivered major features in the lineage model editor using TypeScript and C#
* Built an agentic AI system embedded directly into the model editor
* Worked closely with UX designers to make the platform more accessible for non-technical users
* Gained experience in financial data lineage, enterprise data structures, and cross-team engineering

## Research & Final Year Project

### Self-Contradiction Detection in Public Figures’ Speech

My final year project focuses on developing an NLP system to identify contradictions in public figures’ statements over time. This involves:

* Natural language inference
* Temporal analysis
* Linguistic reasoning in real-world political discourse
